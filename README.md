# RxJS Practice

## Background Information
This repository was created to learn RxJs. The examples are adapted from @matepapp's 
[repository](https://github.com/matepapp/rxjs-learning) and [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhggNGsSQyg).

## Running the Code Examples
Examples have been saved in `./examples`. Copy and paste the code from an example file into `./app/main.ts`. Then 
run `npm start` to start the server and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.  

If you're receiving an error, you may need to update imports to reflect the relative location of the `helpers.ts` file. 

In the browser, you'll see the values that the observables' subscribers are receiving in real time.
